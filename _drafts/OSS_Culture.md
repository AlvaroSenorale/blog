At Xmartlabs we make use of a lot of open source projects. When we face a no domain-based problem we try to find out a robust OSS project to solve it. If we found one that fits the app needs, we contribute over it making feature suggestions, reporting bugs and making pull request.

In case we don't find a good solution, we invest time to craft a elegant open source solution giving back to the ecosystem and  making our contribution.

No one at Xmartlabs likes to solve the same problem over and over again, no one likes to waste time doing simple or already solved tasks. We do not reinvent the wheel, we wisely invest our time solving complex problems, finding the most elegant solution and making the difference.

Open sourcing is all about collaboration, learn, teach, create elegant, robust, well tested and documented solutions. All this is done openly, collaboratively and passionately. Everyone in our team believe in the open source ideas, its power and its benefits.

We really believe that open sourcing our code and using open source solutions we are able to build top quality apps. Primarily because we get the benefits of something created collaboratively and used and tested by thousands. Bug detection by the community is super fast as well as bug fixes and technical support. As Raymond says "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". Continuous improvements either by adding features, making it more robust through continuous integrations tests, etc is supported by many developers getting more elegant solutions.

There are infinite benefits of open source but nothing more gratifying than be able to work with great developers from around the globe, learning, teaching and making decisions with people that you have not even known face to face.

This constant commitment to working together in order to make something that could make a developer day easier is what we really call open source.

During the last year and a half we have been spending a great time contributing with many OSS projects (mostly Cocoa projects but we have also shared a nodejs project and a apache cordova library) as well as contributions to community projects through bug reports and fixes. See all our projects at [Xmartlabs Github account](https://github.com/xmartlabs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=+only%3Asources+).


Exacly one year ago we released [XLForm](https://github.com/xmartlabs/XLForm), a powerful iOS library to easily create dynamic table-view forms. XForm was top trending github repository many times, it has been featured by [iOSBytes podcast](https://iosbytes.codeschool.com/episodes/16-episode-16-april-17-2014/stories/118-xlform), and it got the attention of many cocoa active contributors.

About one month ago `XLForm` was selected to be included in [CocoaPods Testing Jam](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Test-Jammin/) because it is on of [200 most popular]((https://github.com/CocoaPods/search.cocoapods.org/blob/master/lib/models/pod.rb#L43-L56)) CocoaPod libraries. We are extremely excited about that. The idea behind the Test Jam open source community event is to improrve the quality of popular cocoaPods libraries adding test cases making them less prone to error and more maintainable. CocoaPods Testing Jam will be taking part in 18th & 19th 2015 at SF, NY, London and other locations.
