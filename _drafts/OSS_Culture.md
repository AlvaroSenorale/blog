During the last year and half we have been spending a great time releasing different OSS projects and contributing to community projects through bug reports and fixes (you can check all our projects at [Xmartlabs Github account](https://github.com/xmartlabs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=+only%3Asources+)). There are two particular events that I wanted to highlight and made me reflect on this. This seems like a good opportunity to share some thoughts about how we approach open source and what it means to us.

1. Exacly one year ago we released [XLForm](https://github.com/xmartlabs/XLForm), a powerful iOS library to easily create dynamic table-view forms. XLForm was top trending github repository many times, it has been featured by [iOSBytes podcast](https://iosbytes.codeschool.com/episodes/16-episode-16-april-17-2014/stories/118-xlform), and it got the attention of many cocoa active contributors.

2. About one month ago `XLForm` was selected to be included in [CocoaPods Testing Jam](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Test-Jammin/) because it is one of the [200 most popular](https://github.com/CocoaPods/search.cocoapods.org/blob/master/lib/models/pod.rb#L43-L56) CocoaPod libraries. We are extremely excited about that. The idea behind the Test Jam open source community event is to improrve the quality of popular cocoaPods libraries adding test cases making them less prone to error and more maintainable. CocoaPods Testing Jam will be taking part in April 18th & 19th, 2015 at SF, NY, London and other locations.

At Xmartlabs we make use of a lot of open source projects. When we face a no domain-based problem we try to find out a robust OSS project to solve it. If we find one that fits the app needs, we contribute over it making feature suggestions, reporting bugs or making pull requests.

If we don't find a good solution and we are facing a repetitive problem, a good first step is to create a modular solution, taking into account how an external user would use the library. While we replicate the solution,  we incrementally invest time to refine the solution and polish the documentation, resulting in a robust solution that can be shared with the community.

No one at Xmartlabs likes to solve the same problem over and over again, no one likes to waste time doing simple or already solved tasks. We make a conscious effort to avoid reinventing the wheel and wisely invest our time solving complex problems. In our experience this results in great productivity and efficiency wins, finding an elegant solution pays for itself faster than you might expect.

Open sourcing is all about collaboration. Learn, teach, create elegant, robust, well tested and documented solutions. All this is done openly, collaboratively and passionately. Everyone in our team believe in the open source core values, its power and its benefits.

We really believe that by open sourcing our code and using open source solutions we are able to build top quality apps. Primarily because we get the benefits of something created collaboratively and used and tested by thousands. Bug detection by the community is super fast as well as bug fixes and technical support. As Raymond says "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". Continuous improvements either by adding features, making it more robust through continuous integrations tests, etc is supported by many developers getting more elegant solutions.

There are infinite benefits of open source but nothing more gratifying than being able to work with great developers from around the globe, learning, teaching and making decisions with people that you have not even known face to face.

This constant commitment to work together in order to make something that could make a developer day easier is what we really call open source. Hopefully this might encourage others to join!
