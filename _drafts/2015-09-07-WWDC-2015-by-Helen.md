If you are an iOS lover and specially a developer I guess you've wonder about the WWDC at least once. This year someone suggested I should go and BOOM!! the idea of being there got stuck in my mind! I tried the lottery but couldn't get in, the only thing remaining was the Apple scholarship, so I applied! 3 days before the deadline I started developing my app, and...what happened? I WON!! AHHHHH!! 
I still remember the moment I got the email from Apple saying `You've won a WDDC 2015 Scholarship` it was amazing!! I couldn't believe how lucky and honored I was!
<p>
That's how my first WWDC experience started!
</p>

<p>
I arrived to San Francisco on Friday afternoon, it was my first time at the US so getting to stay in a city like that made the experience even more incredible. My first wwdc day started on Sunday after picking up my conference badge and jacket, with the cool swift code tag!

On Sunday we were invited to a special orientation. The place was awesome, there were Apple engineers everywhere, hearing the story of one of the one of the `UIKit` engineers about making his first commit to the project was amazing.

We had the most inspiring talks, one of them hitted me like no other did in my life (really!). This guy talked about `Technology` and `Liberal arts` and how Apple as a company is a life image of that mix. For me as a tech person and also a musician hearing this was really moving, on how we were born with a fundamental life skill, that is programming, but what really should move us is our passion, our heart, for me, my music.

<blockquote>
We are a technology company that is almost as disinterested in technology as any other place I've ever been... 
The technology we are interested in?... 
we connect human being to human being [full stop].. 
We happened to use technology to do it... 
and we are so delight that we find some other folks who have the same attraction.

That day I also met the great Paul Hegarty, he was my first iOS teacher, when I started learning iOS I watched his Stanford videos.

Even Tim Cook showed himself there. That morning was full of surprises and awesome feelings. I left the place with new friends, new horizons, new ideas, so excited to see what's next! 
</div>
<br/>

So as my first day was gone, it was just a matter of time to get even more anxious for `The Keynote`.
At around 7 a.m, you start going into the Moscone. Once inside, you go through very long queues to get to the Presidio, which keeps raising your excitement level, and when you get to the third floor people start running, that moment was epic! jaja

<p>
The whole presentation was awesome, they managed to keep people excitement, from the opening movie, over the El Capitan preview, to the new iPad multitasking features and the Apple Watch advancements, coming to the point where they introduced Apple Music, that was for me, as a musician, the best part.
</p>

So the week started, everyday I checked which sessions I'd attend, you’ve probably watched some of them, but it’s nothing like seeing them live, feeling people's reactions to new features and enhancements; You suddenly find yourself standing up cheering when they introduce something jaja.

But not all the fun is in the sessions, there is much happening when the sessions are over, sometimes those are more important, than being at a session which you can watch later.

<p>
The side events are awesome, you meet all kind of people, those who inspire you, those who make you grow as a developer, people you admire, that you have use their open source libraries, those who makes you want to go back home and create new and awesome apps, for me this was the most enriching part of the week. During the WWDC week San Francisco is full of tech people. Bars, restaurants, everywhere you go there will be a side event, party or meetup, whatever excuse to get together. But the halls of Moscone are still an amazing place for social interaction, moreover having the opportunity to be at the scholarship lounge, a special place they setted up for scholars, there I met the coolest people and inspiring, there is were I made my friends with whom I still talk today.

Raphael with his Ludwig Project, his app brings music to everyone with passion and equality, I met him in the scholarship lounge.
</div>

<br/>
<p>
But sessions are not all. The labs! my first experience in the labs was amazing I was able to debug my swift code side by side with one of the Swift engineers, he gave me tips, he knew where to put breakpoints in my code, and we even discussed my code! and if something goes wrong they even recognize their own mistakes, that shows the humanity behind the framework we use everyday and the respect we should have for them.
</p>

<p>
This year the female power was noticeable the scholarship lounge was full of girls. Every year the overwhelming majority of WWDC attendees has always been male, but Apple is stepping up its own efforts to encourage more women to take prominent roles in tech. 
One more thing that makes me love Apple <3.
</p>

<p>
As the week was reaching its end, there was the bash party, that day I met Craig Federighi. I remember walking on the scholarship lounge and suddenly crossing him, I freezed and the realized it was him! the guy it's just great, very humble, it was great to meet him.

I think I wrote a lot just for one post, maybe next time I can tell more stories :)
But I'm missing a very important thing:

# My Scholarship App

AH here is [my WWDC app](https://github.com/HelOlhausen/HelenOlhausen) I am a passionate musician and singer/songwriter, so I mixed my "talents" to make an app about this, which I ended up doing it in three day. 
I integrated [soundcloud's public API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide) using [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) to get my tracks and the info related to them. For the UI, I used size classes and cocoapods to integrate the beautiful [XLPagerTabStrip](https://github.com/xmartlabs/XLPagerTabStrip). I coded in both `objc` and `swift` and added some cool writing about myself and a little game with the scrolling. I sent it like 30 minutes before the deadline jaja I never thought I'd get the scholarship!
