We are incredibly excited to announce Eureka!, our first Swift open source project designed to easily build table-view forms.

#**Why we built Eureka!**

April last year we released XLForm, an open source obj-c iOS library to build dynamic complex forms based on a DSL. Luckily it has been largely used by iOS community and in thousands of apps saving a lot of development time.

After Swift release a huge part of the iOS community started to use XLForm from Swift projects. We added support for Swift but we were not able to use all of the Swift language benefits so we rethought XLForm and built something from scratch following the swift way and taking advantage of all Swift language capabilities.

#**About Eureka!**

Eureka is a library that can be used to create dynamic table-view forms and which uses a high level DSL abstraction to define the forms. Sounds familiar? (hint: XLForm)

##What's make Eureka so special?

Eureka was originally designed to be:

* Elegant, concise syntax and super readable.
* Fully customizable.
* Safe.
* Powerful and Flexible.
* Extensible.
* Support dynamic table-view forms

Eureka takes advantage of Swift language capabilities such as functional, generics and protocol oriented programming, operators, protocol extensions and much more to accomplish these design goals.  

Let's deep into what we mean by each of the listed points.

### Elegant, concise syntax and super readable

Eureka uses a chainable approach along with custom swift operators to declare a table-view form.

{% highlight swift %}
self.form +++=  DateRow("Date") {
                  $0.value = NSDate()
                  $0.title = "The clock says:"
                }
           <<<  CheckRow("Check") {
                  $0.title = "Check"
                  $0.value = true
                }
           +++  SegmentedRow<Emoji>("SegmentedRow") {
                  $0.title = "Who are You?"
                  $0.options = [üíÅ, üçê, üë¶, üêó, üêº, üêª]
                  $0.value = üçê
                }
           <<<  PhoneRow("Phone") { $0.placeholder = "Phone" }
{% endhighlight %}

###Support dynamic table-view forms

Eureka provides a very powerful DSL used to create a form, basically a form is represented by a `Form` instance that contains   `Section`s which finally contains rows. This data structure is identical to how table-view deals with the sections and cells.
Typically any form we might build needs to make a form row or section visible/invisible depending on a certain condition or action. To address this problem Eureka keeps track of any change made on the `Form` and update the `FormViewController` table view accordingly and on the fly. This means that any change made through insertion, deletion or replacement of either a row or a section will be reflected on the `FormViewController` tableView.
Based on that using Eureka you made changes working with the Eureka DSL and you don't need to deal with table-view dataSource and delegate any more.

### Fully customizable

Typically there is no need to define a new `Row` to customize the appearance of a row or a cell.

However, full customization is supported. Eureka! provides 2 customization levels, general and individual customization. Individual customization always overrides general customization.

####General customization

General customization allows us to make changes to all rows or cells of a specific type.

{% highlight swift %}
// set up minimumDate for all DateRows
DateRow.defaultRowInitializer = { row in row.minimumDate = NSDate() }
// modify all NameRow cell textField font to UIFont.systemFontOfSize(fontSize: 12.0)
NameRow.defaultCellUpdate = { cell, row in cell.textField?.font =  UIFont.systemFontOfSize(fontSize: 12.0)  }
// Modify all CheckRow cells in order to show a orange check mark.  
CheckRow.defaultCellSetup = { cell, row in cell.tintColor = UIColor.orangeColor() }
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that the cell and row parameters are strongly typed and these 3 method are injected automatically through protocol extensions since all rows should conform to `RowProtocol`.

####Individual customization

Individual customization allows us to make changes to a particular row or cell instance.

{% highlight swift %}
// Every row has a initializer that receive a tag and a initializer blog
// as a first and second parameter respectively.
let segmentedRow =  SegmentedRow<Emoji>("Emoji"){
                      $0.title = "Who are You?"  // set up the row title
                      $0.options = [üíÅ, üçê, üë¶, üêó, üêº, üêª] // available options
                      $0.value = üçê // selected value
                      $0.isDisabled = true // disable the row by default
                    }
// Every Row has a cellSetup and cellUpdate method that receive a function as a parameter and
// return the row concrete type instance.
let nameRow =  NameRow("Name").cellSetup { cell, row in
                                cell.textField.placeholder = "Your name ..."
                              }
                              .cellUpdate {
                                $0.cell.textLabel?.textColor = UIColor.redColor()
                              }
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that the parameter function type is `(NameCell, NameRow) -> ()` for NameRow and is `(SegmentedRow<Emoji>, SegmentedCell<Emoji>) -> ()` for SegmentedRow<Emoji> row.

### Safe

Each Eureka `Row` allocates a **strongly typed** value and any form definition and configuration is made over specific concrete objects types.

For example in the code example shown above `$0` is an instance of `DateRow`, `CheckRow` and `SegmentedRow<Emoji>` in the first, second and third row respectively. CheckRow's `value` property type is `Bool` whereas DateRow's `value` property type is `NSDate`. Similarly SegmentedRow<Emoji>'s `options` array property only stores `Emoji` objects and `options` is not available in `CheckRow` nor `DateRow`.

Additionally Eureka makes sure that each new user defined `Row` has a specific value type and a specific TableViewCell type, this is possible combining Swift Generics and Type Constraints. By definition any `Row` must extend from `Row<T: Equatable, CellType: GenericCellProtocol where CellType: BaseCell, CellType.ValueType == T>` class ensuring that each `Row` has a defined value type `T` and works with a specific table view cell `CellType` which holds a row of type `T`.

I can ensure Eureka is super safe either during form creation or when defining new `Row` and cell types.

### Powerful and Flexible

Eureka allows us to easily attach onChange and onSelect handlers to a row.

{% highlight swift %}
let segmentedRow =  SegmentedRow<Emoji>("Emoji"){
                      $0.title = "Who are You?"  // set up the row title
                      $0.options = [üíÅ, üçê, üë¶, üêó, üêº, üêª] // available options
                    }
                    .onChange { row in print(row.value?.name) } // row.value is Emoji?, name is a stored property
                    .onCellSelection { cell, row in print("Cell was selected") }
{% endhighlight %}

#### Form and Section conforms to RangeReplaceableCollectionType, MutableCollectionType

As you may know, Eureka `Forms` contains a list of `Section` and a section contains a list of rows. We made `Form` and `Section` conform to `RangeReplaceableCollectionType` and `MutableCollectionType`, both "extends" from the well known `CollectionType`.

Doing that we gain for free a lot of helpers and behaviour and we are able to iterate over the collection, use subscript to access and modify a Section or a row, make use of some cool functions like map, filter, first, appendContentsOf, removeAtIndex, removeRange, replaceRange, reduce and much much more.

Let's see this in action assuming form is an instance of Form:

{% highlight swift %}
// let's get second form section and append a new DateRow
let section_two = form[1] <<< DateRow("Date") { $0.value = NSDate() } // we can also use append instead of <<< operator

// What about completle replace section two
form[1] = newSection // ;)

// lets add a new button row to all sections
for (index, section) in form.enumerate() {
    section <<< ButtonRow("Button\(index)") { $0.title = "Some title" }
}

// replace rows from 3 to 7 by a checkRow
section_two.replaceRange(3..<7, with: [CheckRow("checkRow")])

// we can also look up for CheckRows inside a section by..
section_two.filter { $0 is CheckRow }

// one more example
form += [newSection1, newSection2]
section += [newRow1, newRow2, newRow3]

//And there are much more possibilities ;)
{% endhighlight %}


###Extensible

Adding a new `Row` definition is super simple by extending `Row<Type, CellType>` and conforming to `RowProtocol`. The basic behaviour of the row is inherited either from the superclass or added through protocol extension. Based on that you should only provide the row definition and the UITableViewCell that the `Row` handles. Eureka provides many rows by default that actually has  no a conceptual difference from a user defined row.


This post is intended to briefly introduce Eureka and some of its architecture insights.
If you are interested in how to use Eureka I would suggest you to take a look at github repository documentation.
